FIXED VAE Configuration
=======================
Model Type: Standard VAE
Input Shape: (1025, 938)
Latent Dimension: 128
Beta: 0.0001
Learning Rate: 1e-05
Gradient Clipping: 0.5
Number of Classes: 0
Total Parameters: 738,347,201

FIXES APPLIED:
- Reduced architecture complexity (3 conv layers)
- Lower learning rate (1e-05)
- Smaller latent dimension (128)
- Much smaller beta (0.0001)
- Aggressive gradient clipping (0.5)
- Logvar initialization and clamping
- KL loss clamping
- NaN/Inf detection and handling
- Early stopping conditions
